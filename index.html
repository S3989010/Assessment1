				<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
        <p>I like the possibilities and problem solving aspects of IT. For example, during the pandemic, the changes technology has had in terms of day to day life are amazing. I can order almost anything from anywhere delivered to my house. This demonstrates the possibilities that we can create using technology as well as solving a problem for many people who were stuck at home or who were trying to conduct business during the pandemic.</p>
        <p>Growing up my older brother was really into computers and gadgets etc. He showed me a lot of what computers could do and how he was able to use that to solve problems that he was facing. I was book keeping for my parents when I was in year 8 at school (1999). My brother helped my create a spreadsheet on the computer to keep track of bills and payments as in those days I had to make phone calls or go into the post office to pay bills and it was hard to track throughout the month. </p>
        <p>I am studying online through Open Universities. I am studying Commerce and Majoring in Accounting. When I was choosing my units for study period 4 2022 I was given a list of electives. I chose introduction to IT and Introduction to Programming as they seemed the most relevant to my degree and they happened to be through RMIT. </p>
        <p>I hope to gain insight into IT and some relevant concepts that could help me in my chosen career path in the future. I think having some knowledge of how IT works will assist me in problem solving and maybe even give me a leg up in terms of competition relating to employment.</p>
