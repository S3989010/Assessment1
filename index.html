				<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
        <p>I like the possibilities and problem solving aspects of IT. For example, during the pandemic, the changes technology has had in terms of day to day life are amazing. I can order almost anything from anywhere delivered to my house. This demonstrates the possibilities that we can create using technology as well as solving a problem for many people who were stuck at home or who were trying to conduct business during the pandemic.</p>
        <p>Growing up my older brother was really into computers and gadgets etc. He showed me a lot of what computers could do and how he was able to use that to solve problems that he was facing. I was book keeping for my parents when I was in year 8 at school (1999). My brother helped my create a spreadsheet on the computer to keep track of bills and payments as in those days I had to make phone calls or go into the post office to pay bills and it was hard to track throughout the month. </p>
        <p>I am studying online through Open Universities. I am studying Commerce and Majoring in Accounting. When I was choosing my units for study period 4 2022 I was given a list of electives. I chose introduction to IT and Introduction to Programming as they seemed the most relevant to my degree and they happened to be through RMIT. </p>
        <p>I hope to gain insight into IT and some relevant concepts that could help me in my chosen career path in the future. I think having some knowledge of how IT works will assist me in problem solving and maybe even give me a leg up in terms of competition relating to employment.</p>

            <img src="Ideal Job.jpg"/>
          </div>
          <h2>Position Description</h2>
  				<p>The position includes multiple levels of hands on work including collecting and analysing data and building reports. It also includes a management aspect which involves using interpersonal skills to drive efficiency within the team. There is also many aspects of problem solving which includes responding to financial enquiries and interpreting data. </p>
          <p>This position appeals to me based on the points mentioned above. I enjoy the hands on approach to my work as well as being able to utilise my interpersonal and management skills and I am very interested in the problem solving aspects this job has to offer. It also offers growth within the company and the ability to progress to a C-suite position.</p>
          <h2>Qualifications and Experience</h2>
          <p>This position requires a tertiary qualification in the field of Commerce. It also shows experience is required in programs such as Excel and the ability to meet deadlines and be organised and efficient. There is mention of attention to detail and being detail-oriented throughout the experience description which would also be important to demonstrate.</p>
          <p>I am currently studying a Bachelor of Commerce majoring in Accounting which would suit this role. I am in the first year still and plan to complete by the middle of 2025. Throughout my working history so far, I have had extensive experience in using Excel. I have predominantly worked within a corporate environment for my whole working life so far where meeting deadlines, being organised and having a strong sense of attention to detail has been imperative. My current role is a management role within a corporate environment and I continue to hone my skill set relating to the above mentioned desired qualifications and experiences.</p>
          <h2>The Plan</h2>
          <p>My plan is to continuously study to ensure I obtain my degree by 2025. I am also utilising my current position to improve on my skills and experiences through mentorship from our finance department, taking up opportunities to work outside the scope of my position including caretaking the region for my boss while they are on leave. I have also been developing my network through attending conferences and establishing relationships with stakeholders within the local community and around the country.</p>

    				<h1>Personality Profile</h1>
            <h2>Test One</h2>
            <div id=test1>
              <img src="Test 1.jpg"/>
            </div>
    				<p>I think overall it is quite accurate. The workplace behaviours and career path sections were the most accurate for me. It will be difficult to be apart of a team that is lead by someone else if they are not as invested in the team as I am. It may also be difficult for me to engage if there are too many people within the group that take up more time than others in terms of talking time etc.</p>
            <p>I would need to make sure I can be actively involved in the team hierarchy selection process. I would need to help establish ground rules for the team to ensure everyone gets heard and if anyone is not participating or contributing, have rules in place to deal with that too (i.e. team contract).</p>
            <h2>Test Two</h2>
            <div id=test1>
              <img src="Test 2.jpg"/>
            </div>
            <p>I would agree with these results to some degree. I wouldn’t say that I am only a visual learner but I do visualise things and remember better when I do so.</p>
            <p>I think this would be a benefit to the team in relation to sharing and retaining of information. It would be a good idea to discuss everyone’s learning styles to determine which is the best way we can communicate and share information that will benefit everyone.</p>
            <h2>Test Three</h2>
            <div id=test1>
              <img src="Test 3.jpg"/>
            </div>
            <p>I thought it would have been higher but this was the test I didn’t agree with most out of the three. The questions seemed to be a bit restrictive causing me to choose less information.</p>
            <p>Creativity is important especially when working on a group assignment so I believe this will be helpful to the group. I think it will be important to work out if the other members of the group are at the same or different level. This will help when deciding the roles each member will play within the group.</p>

      				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
              <h2>Overview</h2>
      				<p>My project idea is an app that compares the price of grocery items from stores within the user’s area, to show users where they can find the cheapest options. This allows users to input a shopping list and have all the prices show for each item for each store listed and allows the user to compare the cost and shop for specials.</p>
              <h2>Motivation</h2>
              <p>The price of groceries is quite high and there are always deals and discounts available in various supermarkets which are hard to keep track of or to find. I chose this idea to allow people to easily find the items they are looking for and plan their shopping trips accordingly. Using an app to do the work will replace the need for people to look up items individually online or by sorting through catalogues.</p>
              <h2>Description</h2>
              <p>My project idea is to create an app that compares the pricing for grocery items in supermarkets and shops within an area that the user chooses. The app will be called Grocery Hunter. I chose this name as it contains descriptive words relating to what the app does as well as provides an easy to find search word when looking for apps related to the word ‘grocery’.</p>
              <p>Users will input their postcode to filter the shop results to a particular area. Users can then build a shopping list by entering the items they are interested in purchasing into the app. This will then allow the app to filter results based on the user’s selections of area and items giving them the options of shops available and the price for the items in each of the available shops. The app will take information that is inputted from the user to provide the desired results. The app won’t need user information in the form of a profile or account as users will be prompted to enter in location and items they are searching for each time they use the app. </p>
              <h2>Outcome</h2>
              <p>If the app works as its suppose to, users will be able to create shopping lists and plan their trip, to find the best prices for the items they have added. They will also be able to select different locations in case they are planning to travel.</p>
